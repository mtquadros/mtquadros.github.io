# Distributed Group System
The goal of this project is build a module that implements a group of hosts
in the same LAN (Local Area Network) that provide an API for programming
distributed applications with crash fault tolerance.

## About the code
The code is unlicensed and it is in a private repository, and available just for
job interviews of the owner.

## About demonstrations
I will try to maintain this page updated with the new features

## Notes: Some features until the moment,
1. Any host in same local network can join the distributed group of hosts;
2. Once a host joins the group it knows all others members and vice versa;
3. If the member leaves the group it "forget" all other members and vice versa. 

## Work in progress,
1. Improve the information on the screen for debugging and demonstration of the
features;
2. Fix bugs;
3. Implement new distributed building block features;
4. Implement the fault tolerance to crash failures;
5. Implement a interface for applications.
